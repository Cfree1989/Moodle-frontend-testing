## Lessons (Carried Forward from Phase 1)

### Core Technical Principles - PROVEN
- **Table-based layouts are immune to sanitization** and provide structural integrity
- **Inline CSS only** - style blocks and external CSS get stripped
- **Use keyword CSS values** instead of numeric (e.g., "bold" not "700")
- **Simple HTML structures** avoid sanitization complications
- **Test save/reload cycles** during development to catch sanitization issues

### Advanced Patterns Discovered - VALIDATED
- **Border-spacing technique** for consistent table-based layouts
- **Nested table elimination** reduces code complexity by 50%
- **CSS !important declarations** prevent Moodle theme overrides
- **Web-safe font stacks** ensure consistent rendering
- **Pixel-based sizing** for precise control in table layouts

### Security and Sanitization Rules - DOCUMENTED
- **JavaScript execution** limited but functional for basic interactivity
- **Media embedding** works with proper iframe implementation
- **Custom data attributes** preserved in most cases
- **HTML comments** removed during sanitization process
- **CSS normalization** occurs on save/reload cycles

### Development Workflow - OPTIMIZED
- **Documentation-first approach** ensures knowledge retention
- **Systematic testing methodology** yields comprehensive results
- **Code optimization phase** essential for production readiness
- **Screenshot documentation** critical for visual validation
- **Version comparison** helps understand sanitization behavior

### New Phase 2 Focus Areas
- **Responsive design** within table constraints
- **Accessibility compliance** as primary requirement
- **Performance optimization** for large-scale deployment
- **Cross-theme compatibility** testing
- **Automated validation** for ongoing maintenance
